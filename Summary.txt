Project Summary
This project analyzed the relationship between market sentiment and trader behavior using Hyperliquid trading data and the Fear & Greed Index. 
Results show that trader performance improves during Greed phases, while Fear periods are associated with lower average PnL and higher volatility. 
Behavioral analysis indicates increased trading activity and risk-taking during positive sentiment, and more defensive positioning during Fear. 
Segment-level insights reveal that high-variance traders are more negatively impacted during Fear regimes. 
These findings suggest that sentiment-aware risk controls and trader segmentation can materially improve trading outcomes.
